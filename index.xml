      <description>I needed to get a list of all the repositories for a specific Github Organisation. Github limits the page size which you have use which ruled out a single call with a large value. I was also writing this routine in bash and less is more as they say.
My approach was very simplistic in that it simply tried an incrementing value for next page and if the response was empty then the end of the list had been reached.</description>

      <title>Getting back into blogging with Hugo!</title>

      <description>This is a first blog post whilst I get this site back up and running using Hugo.
The deployment option which I am using is the one where you use one github repository to store all the source and raw material and another github repository for the generated artefacts which are then published on github pages. There other ways of doing this (e.g. using a branch), which I tried, but I settled with the two repos approach.</description>
