      <description>I needed to get a list of all the repositories for a specific Github Organisation. Github limits the page size which you have use which ruled out a single call with a large value. I was also writing this routine in bash and less is more as they say.
My approach was very simplistic in that it simply tried an incrementing value for next page and if the response was empty then the end of the list had been reached.</description>
