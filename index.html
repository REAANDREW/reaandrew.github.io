    <p>This is part of a mini series of blog posts building a simple stress tool in Go. The contents of the series can be found here.
Must be continually built and published to github releases supporting Windows, Linux and Mac The first part is to create a new repository and setup the continuous integration environment which I will use github and circleci for respectively. I will name the repository and the project maul.

    <p>Introduction One of the tools that has really stuck in my mind over the years is the siege stress test tool https://github.com/JoeDog/siege. It was really simple to use, give it a list of urls, add some command line arguments including concurrency, time etc&hellip; and it would begin testing those urls with really clear output. At the end of the test run it would print out statistics for the entire test like requests per second, average response time etc&hellip; One thing it also did was make a log of these statistics in tabular form in a file in the home directory which was really useful to compare performance against historical runs.

    <p>This is a first blog post whilst I get this site back up and running using Hugo.
The deployment option which I am using is the one where you use one github repository to store all the source and raw material and another github repository for the generated artefacts which are then published on github pages. There other ways of doing this (e.g. using a branch), which I tried, but I settled with the two repos approach.
